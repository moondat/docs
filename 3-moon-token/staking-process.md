# Staking Process

## Platform Participation Through Staking

MoonDat.social offers two different staking systems, each with unique benefits and reward structures.

## Two Staking Options

### 1. $MOON Token Staking
- Earn 20% of ALL platform trading fees
- Access airdrops from every new token launch
- Receive rewards from the entire ecosystem

### 2. Individual Token Staking
- Earn 40% of trading fees for specific tokens
- Higher percentage but concentrated to specific tokens
- Express confidence in particular tweet tokens

## The 5-Day Cooldown Period

Both staking systems include a 5-day cooldown period when unstaking:

- When you initiate unstaking, tokens enter a 5-day cooldown
- No rewards are earned during this period
- For $MOON staking, you cannot claim airdrops during cooldown
- After 5 days complete, tokens are returned to your wallet

This mechanism encourages longer-term commitment while preventing opportunistic behavior.

## $MOON Staking Benefits

$MOON staking creates a balanced reward profile:

- **Steady Fee Income**: Proportional share of platform-wide fees
- **Token Airdrops**: Access to all new token launches at 10:1 ratio
- **Diversified Exposure**: Benefits from all ecosystem activity
- **Compounding Potential**: Returns can increase stake over time

## Token Staking Benefits

Individual token staking offers:

- **Higher Fee Percentage**: 40% vs. 20% for $MOON staking
- **Focused Returns**: Concentrated on specific tokens you believe in
- **Stronger Price Support**: Staking reduces circulating supply
- **Conviction Expression**: Back specific tweets with your capital

## Strategic Considerations

When deciding between staking options:

- **$MOON Staking**: Better for platform-wide exposure and airdrops
- **Token Staking**: Better for high-conviction plays on specific tokens
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of both for balanced exposure

The staking mechanisms are designed to reward different participation strategies while maintaining the health and growth of the overall ecosystem.
