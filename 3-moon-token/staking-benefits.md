# Staking Benefits

## Dual Rewards for $MOON Holders

Staking your $MOON tokens unlocks two powerful reward streams that create ongoing returns from the entire platform ecosystem.

## 1. Trading Fee Revenue

**20% of ALL trading fees** across the entire MoonDat.social platform are distributed to $MOON stakers based on their proportion of the staking pool.

As the platform grows and more tokens generate trading volume, these rewards naturally increase without requiring any additional action from stakers.

## 2. Token Airdrops

Every token launched on MoonDat.social allocates **10% of its supply** (100 million tokens) for $MOON stakers.

These tokens can be claimed at a ratio of **10 $MOON : 1 new token**.

For example:
- If you stake 1 million $MOON tokens
- You can claim up to 100,000 tokens from each new launch
- With multiple tokens launching regularly, this creates a continuous stream of new assets

## The Combined Value Proposition

This dual reward system creates a powerful value proposition:

- **Steady Fee Income**: Regular returns from platform-wide trading
- **Token Portfolio Growth**: Exposure to every new token launch
- **Diversified Returns**: Not dependent on any single token's success
- **Early Access Advantage**: Get tokens before broader market awareness

## Staking Requirements

To receive these benefits:

- Stake any amount of $MOON tokens
- Maintain staked position (5-day unstaking period)
- Actively claim airdrops within their claim windows
- Unstaking disables rewards during the cooldown period

## Strategic Advantages

The $MOON staking system offers several strategic advantages:

1. **Passive Portfolio Building**: Accumulate a diverse set of tokens automatically
2. **Ecosystem-Wide Exposure**: Benefit from all platform activity
3. **Compounding Potential**: Use rewards to increase stake size over time
4. **Selective Claiming**: Choose which airdrops to prioritize based on potential

For those who believe in the long-term potential of tweet tokenization, $MOON staking provides the broadest and most efficient exposure to the entire ecosystem's growth.
