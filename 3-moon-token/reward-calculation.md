# Reward Calculation

## Understanding Your Potential Returns

MoonDat.social implements a transparent reward system for all participants. This section explains how rewards are calculated for different platform roles.

## Trading Fee Rewards

All trades on the platform generate a 0.3% fee, which is distributed according to the platform's allocation model.

### For $MOON Stakers (20%)

Your share of rewards is based on your proportion of the total $MOON staked:

```
Your Daily Reward = (Total Platform Volume × 0.3% × 20%) × (Your Staked $MOON / Total Staked $MOON)
```

For example:
- If total daily platform volume is $1,000,000
- Total fees generated would be $3,000
- $MOON stakers share would be $600 (20%)
- If you have 1% of staked $MOON, you would earn $6 daily

### For Token Stakers (40%)

Your share of specific token rewards follows a similar formula:

```
Your Daily Reward = (Token Volume × 0.3% × 40%) × (Your Staked Tokens / Total Staked Tokens)
```

For example:
- If a token's daily volume is $100,000
- Fees generated would be $300
- Token stakers share would be $120 (40%)
- If you have 10% of staked tokens, you would earn $12 daily

### For Token Creators (10%)

Creator rewards are straightforward:

```
Creator Reward = Token Volume × 0.3% × 10%
```

For example:
- If your created token's daily volume is $100,000
- You would earn $30 daily (10% of $300 fees)

## Airdrop Calculation

The airdrop system follows a fixed 10:1 ratio:

```
Maximum Claimable Tokens = Your Staked $MOON ÷ 10
```

For example:
- If you stake 5,000,000 $MOON
- You can claim up to 500,000 tokens from each new launch
- If 10 new tokens launch weekly, that's access to 5,000,000 new tokens weekly

## Volume-Based Reward Scaling

As the platform grows, rewards scale directly with volume:

```
New Reward = Old Reward × (New Volume ÷ Old Volume)
```

For example:
- If rewards are $5 daily at $1M volume
- At $10M volume, rewards would scale to $50 daily

## Comparative Reward Analysis

Different strategies offer different reward profiles:

1. **$MOON Staking**:
    - 20% of all platform fees
    - Access to all token airdrops
    - Platform-wide exposure

2. **Token Staking**:
    - 40% of specific token fees
    - Higher percentage but concentrated risk
    - No airdrop benefits

3. **Token Creation**:
    - 10% of specific token fees
    - No capital lockup required
    - Perpetual revenue stream

Each approach has different risk-reward characteristics, allowing participants to choose based on their strategy and conviction.
