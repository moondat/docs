# Token Distribution

## The 85-10-5 Model

Every token created on MoonDat.social follows a carefully designed distribution model that balances liquidity, community rewards, and creator attribution.

## 1 Billion Total Supply

All tokens launched on the platform have a fixed supply of **1,000,000,000** (1 billion) tokens, creating consistency across the ecosystem.

## Liquidity Pool: 85%

**850,000,000 tokens** (85% of the supply) are automatically paired with ETH and added to Uniswap on Base chain.

This substantial liquidity allocation ensures:
- Immediate tradability
- Reduced price slippage
- Efficient price discovery
- Sustainable trading environment

## Airdrop Allocation: 10%

**100,000,000 tokens** (10% of the supply) are reserved for $MOON token stakers.

This allocation:
- Rewards platform supporters
- Creates built-in distribution
- Incentivizes $MOON staking
- Helps bootstrap the token community

$MOON stakers can claim these tokens at a 10:1 ratio (stake 10 $MOON to claim 1 new token).

## Tweet Author Allocation: 5%

**50,000,000 tokens** (5% of the supply) are reserved for the verified owner of the original tweet.

This allocation:
- Rewards original content creators
- Incentivizes author verification
- Adds legitimacy to tokens
- Creates alignment between authors and token success

## Fee Distribution Structure

Beyond the initial token distribution, all trading fees (0.3% on Uniswap) are shared among stakeholders:

| Recipient | Percentage | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| $MOON Stakers | 20% | Platform-wide support |
| Token Stakers | 40% | Token-specific support |
| Token Creator | 10% | Creation reward |
| Platform | 30% | Development and operations |

This carefully balanced model ensures that all participants benefit from token trading activity in proportion to their contributions to the ecosystem.
