# Owner Verification

## For Tweet Authors: Claim Your 5%

If your tweet has been tokenized on MoonDat.social, you can verify your ownership and claim 5% of the token supply.

## What You Get: 50 Million Tokens

As the verified author of a tokenized tweet, you receive **50,000,000 tokens** (5% of the total supply).

Depending on the token's performance, this could represent significant value derived directly from your content.

## The Value of Verification

Verification creates benefits for everyone:

- **For Authors**: Direct value from your social content
- **For Tokens**: Increased legitimacy and market interest
- **For Traders**: Confidence in the token's authenticity
- **For Ecosystem**: Stronger connection between content and value

## Important Verification Details

- You can only verify **one token** if multiple exist for your tweet
- Verification is permanent and cannot be reversed
- Verification often leads to increased token value and trading activity
- There are no obligations associated with verification

## Token Vesting Schedule

Verified author tokens follow a vesting schedule:

- **Initial Release**: 10% (5 million tokens) available immediately
- **Remaining Tokens**: 90% (45 million tokens) vested over 6 months

This creates immediate benefit while encouraging long-term alignment.

## Multiple Tokens: How to Choose

If multiple tokens exist for your tweet, consider these factors when choosing which to verify:

- Trading volume and liquidity depth
- Community engagement and activity
- Creator communication and promotion
- Your personal preference

Your verification choice can significantly impact which token succeeds in the market.

## After Verification

Once verified, you have several options:

- Hold tokens as a long-term investment
- Stake your tokens to earn 40% of trading fees
- Let your followers know about your verified token
- Trade some tokens when appropriate

The verification system creates a powerful new model for creator economics - where your social content generates direct value without changing how you create.
