# Liquidity Pool Creation

## Instant Trading from Day One

One of MoonDat.social's key innovations is automatic liquidity for every token, ensuring immediate tradeability and market efficiency.

## The 85% Liquidity Allocation

When a token is created on MoonDat.social, **85% of the total supply** (850,000,000 tokens) is automatically paired with ETH and added to Uniswap on Base chain.

## How This Benefits Everyone

This substantial liquidity allocation creates several advantages:

- **Immediate Trading**: No waiting for markets to develop
- **Reduced Slippage**: Better price execution for trades
- **Fair Price Discovery**: Market forces can efficiently determine value
- **Lower Barriers**: Anyone can trade from minute one

## Initial Price Determination

A token's initial price is determined by:
- The ratio of ETH to tokens in the liquidity pool
- Market forces as trading begins

As buying and selling occurs, the price adjusts automatically according to Uniswap's bonding curve mechanism.

## Trading Dynamics

All tokens follow standard Uniswap trading mechanics:
- Automated market maker (AMM) model
- 0.3% fee on all trades
- Price impact based on trade size relative to liquidity
- Permissionless trading for anyone

## The Liquidity Advantage

By solving the "chicken and egg" problem of new token liquidity, MoonDat.social creates:

1. Focus on the underlying tweet content value
2. Equal starting conditions for all tokens
3. Immediate utility without waiting periods
4. Efficient markets from day one

This automatic liquidity system is the foundation that makes the entire ecosystem possible, allowing immediate trading while maintaining focus on the social content that gives each token its unique value proposition.
