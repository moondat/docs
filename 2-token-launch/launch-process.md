# Token Launch Process

## Creating Value from Tweets

MoonDat.social makes it simple to transform tweets into tradeable tokens. Here's what you need to know about the token creation process.

## Finding Valuable Tweets

The foundation of a successful token is selecting the right tweet. Look for:

- **Viral Potential**: Tweets gaining momentum or likely to spread
- **Cultural Significance**: Moments that capture attention
- **Influential Authors**: Content from recognized voices
- **Timely Relevance**: Breaking news or trending topics
- **Historical Value**: Tweets that may become significant in retrospect

Great token creators develop an eye for social content with staying power.

## Creating Your Token

Creating a token is simple:
- Connect your wallet
- Submit a tweet URL
- Confirm the transaction (minimal Base chain gas fees)

Your token is created with:
- 1 billion total supply
- 85% added to Uniswap liquidity
- 10% reserved for $MOON stakers
- 5% reserved for the tweet author
- You registered as the permanent creator

## Benefits of Token Creation

As the token creator, you receive:

- **10% of ALL trading fees** generated by your token
- **Lifetime revenue stream** with no expiration date
- **No ongoing maintenance required** after creation
- **Early positioning** before potential verification or virality

## Strategic Approaches

### Trending Topic Strategy
Create tokens for tweets about breaking news or trending topics that could generate significant short-term trading volume.

### Cultural Moment Strategy
Identify tweets that capture cultural zeitgeist or create memes with potential staying power.

### Verification Potential Strategy
Identify tweets where the author has incentive to verify, such as project announcements or personal milestones.

## Important Considerations

- Multiple tokens can be created for the same tweet
- Authors can only verify one token per tweet
- Verification often significantly impacts token value
- First creators often (but not always) have advantage
- Trading volume directly impacts your creator rewards

Each token you create is an opportunity to establish a permanent position in a potentially valuable social moment.
