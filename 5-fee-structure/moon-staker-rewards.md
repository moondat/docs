# $MOON Staker Rewards

## Platform-Wide Benefits

Staking $MOON tokens provides access to a unique dual reward system that captures value from the entire MoonDat.social ecosystem.

## The 20% Fee Allocation

Of all trading fees generated across the platform (0.3% of trading volume), **20%** is allocated to $MOON stakers. This creates a direct value flow from all platform activity to $MOON supporters.

## Fee Reward Calculation

Your share of trading fee rewards is calculated using this formula:

```
Your Reward = (Total Platform Volume × 0.3% × 20%) × (Your Staked $MOON / Total Staked $MOON)
```

This creates a proportional reward system based on your commitment level relative to all stakers.

## Volume-Based Scaling

As the platform grows, rewards naturally scale with trading volume:

| Daily Platform Volume | Total Platform Fees (0.3%) | $MOON Staker Portion (20%) | Your Share with 1% of Staked $MOON |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| $100,000 | $300 | $60 | $0.60 per day |
| $1,000,000 | $3,000 | $600 | $6 per day |
| $10,000,000 | $30,000 | $6,000 | $60 per day |

This demonstrates how rewards grow directly with platform adoption and activity.

## The Airdrop Advantage

Beyond fee sharing, $MOON stakers receive exclusive access to claim 10% of every token launched on the platform at a 10:1 ratio.

This creates a powerful second revenue stream:

1. **Access to Every Launch**: Claim rights for all new tokens
2. **Portfolio Diversification**: Build exposure across many tokens
3. **Early Positioning**: Get tokens before potential market recognition
4. **Zero Additional Cost**: No purchase required beyond staking

## The Dual Revenue Model

The combination of fee sharing and airdrops creates a unique dual revenue model:

### Fee Revenue:
- Steady, predictable income stream
- Grows with overall platform activity
- Direct correlation with platform success

### Airdrop Revenue:
- Variable upside potential
- Opportunity for significant returns from successful tokens
- Portfolio approach with selective exposure

Together, these create a balanced return profile with both stability and growth opportunity.

## The $MOON Staking Advantage

$MOON staking offers several unique advantages:

1. **Ecosystem-Wide Exposure**: Benefits from all platform activity
2. **Diversified Returns**: Not dependent on any single token's success
3. **First Access Rights**: Claim new tokens before broader market
4. **Compound Potential**: Use rewards to increase stake and future returns
5. **Aligned Incentives**: Direct correlation between platform success and rewards

By staking $MOON, you position yourself at the heart of the platform's economic model, with direct participation in its growth and success through both predictable fee sharing and high-potential token airdrops.
