# Creator Rewards

## Launch and Earn Passively

MoonDat.social establishes a new economic model for token creators – those who identify valuable tweets and initiate the tokenization process.

## The 10% Fee Allocation

Of all trading fees generated by a token (0.3% of trading volume), **10%** is allocated directly to the token creator – the address that originally submitted the tweet URL and created the token.

This creates a perpetual revenue stream tied to the token's trading activity, with no expiration date or diminishing returns.

## Creator Reward Formula

The creator reward calculation is straightforward:

```
Creator Reward = Token's Trading Volume × 0.3% × 10%
```

Unlike staking rewards, creator rewards are not split among multiple participants – the entire 10% allocation goes to the single creator address.

## The Lifetime Revenue Potential

Creator rewards have several distinctive characteristics:

1. **Perpetual Duration**: Returns continue for the lifetime of the token
2. **Zero Maintenance**: No ongoing actions required after creation
3. **No Capital Lock-up**: No staking or funds committed
4. **Pure Upside**: Only the initial gas cost with unlimited upside potential
5. **Volume-Driven**: Returns scale directly with trading activity

Successful token creators focus on:

### Early Identification

- Breaking news or announcements
- Trending topics or emerging memes
- Notable statements from influential figures
- Historically significant moments

### Volume Potential Analysis
Assessing which tweets are likely to generate sustained trading interest:
- Cultural impact and memorability
- Controversial or discussion-generating content
- Connection to valuable communities
- Longevity potential versus fleeting trends

### Diversification Approach
Creating multiple tokens to build a portfolio of creator rewards:
- Spread across different categories and sources
- Balance between high-risk/high-potential and more reliable performers
- Consistent creation of new tokens over time

## The First-Mover Advantage

The MoonDat.social creator system heavily rewards first movers:

1. **Single Creator Model**: Only one address receives the 10% creator reward
2. **Early Platform Advantage**: Less competition for valuable tweets
3. **Category Establishment**: Setting precedents in token categories
4. **Compounding Knowledge**: Learning what works faster than others

The 10% creator allocation represents a significant innovation in content curation incentives, allowing those with an eye for valuable social content to build perpetual revenue streams while contributing to the platform's growth and success.
