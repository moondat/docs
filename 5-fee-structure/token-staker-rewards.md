# Token Staker Rewards

## Focused Benefits for Token Believers

In addition to $MOON staking, MoonDat.social offers a second staking mechanism: staking individual tweet tokens. This system rewards those who believe in specific tokens with a higher percentage of their trading fees.

## The 40% Fee Allocation

Of all trading fees generated by a specific token (0.3% of its trading volume), **40%** is allocated to those staking that particular token. This is double the percentage allocated to $MOON stakers, creating a higher reward rate for token-specific support.

## Token Staking Reward Formula

Your share of token staking rewards is calculated using this formula:

```
Your Reward = (Token's Volume × 0.3% × 40%) × (Your Staked Tokens / Total Staked Tokens)
```

This creates a proportional reward system based on your stake relative to all stakers of that specific token.

## Comparative Reward Potential

The token staking system offers a different risk-reward profile compared to $MOON staking:

| Staking Type | Fee Percentage | Exposure | Risk Profile |
|--------------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| $MOON Staking | 20% of all fees | Platform-wide | Diversified |
| Token Staking | 40% of specific token fees | Token-specific | Concentrated |

## When Token Staking Makes Sense

Token staking is particularly attractive in these scenarios:

### High-Conviction Plays
When you have strong belief in a specific token's potential for high trading volume and activity.

### Trending Tokens
For tokens experiencing momentum and growing community interest that may drive significant trading.

### Verified Author Tokens
Tokens where the tweet author has verified, potentially adding legitimacy and interest.

### Fee Maximization
For highly active tokens where the 40% rate may outperform the broader 20% platform rate.

## Token Staking Economics

The economics of token staking create several important dynamics:

### Higher Percentage, Concentrated Exposure
- 40% is twice the rate of $MOON staking (20%)
- But limited to a single token's performance
- No exposure to broader platform success
- No airdrop benefits

### Volume-Driven Returns
- Returns directly tied to the token's trading volume
- Popular, controversial, or viral-related tokens often see higher volume
- Success often correlates with the original tweet's social relevance

## The 5-Day Unstaking Period

Like $MOON staking, token staking includes a 5-day cooldown period when unstaking:

1. Initiate unstaking process
2. Enter 5-day cooldown period
3. Receive no rewards during cooldown
4. Tokens returned to wallet after 5 days complete

This mechanism encourages thoughtful, longer-term commitment while preventing opportunistic behavior.

## Strategic Considerations

For the most effective approach:

1. **Analyze Volume Trends**: Review historical trading activity
2. **Assess Tweet Fundamentals**: Evaluate the original content's staying power
3. **Consider Verification Status**: Verified tokens often sustain greater interest
4. **Balance Your Portfolio**: Diversify across multiple tokens and $MOON

The token staking mechanism offers a compelling option for those who want to focus their support on specific tokens they believe in, with the potential for higher percentage returns as a reward for their more concentrated commitment.
