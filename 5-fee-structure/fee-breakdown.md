# Fee Breakdown

## Fair Value Distribution

MoonDat.social implements a balanced fee distribution model that rewards all ecosystem participants while ensuring sustainable platform growth.

## Fee Generation Mechanism

All trades of tokens launched on MoonDat.social generate a **0.3% fee** on the transaction value. This is the standard Uniswap fee that applies to all trades.

## Fee Distribution Allocation

Trading fees are distributed according to the following structure:

| Recipient | Percentage | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| $MOON Stakers | 20% | Distributed proportionally to all staked $MOON tokens |
| Token Stakers | 40% | Distributed to those staking the specific token being traded |
| Token Creator | 10% | Sent to the address that initially created the token |
| Platform | 30% | Used for development, operations, and growth |

## The Economics of Fee Distribution

This distribution model creates multiple revenue streams across the ecosystem:

### For $MOON Stakers:
- 20% of fees from ALL tokens launched on the platform
- Earnings proportional to stake size
- Platform-wide exposure regardless of which tokens trade more actively

### For Token Stakers:
- 40% of fees specifically from the token(s) they stake
- Higher percentage but limited to specific token volume
- Concentrated exposure to tokens they believe in

### For Token Creators:
- 10% of all trading fees from tokens they launched
- Lifetime revenue stream requiring no additional work
- Incentive to create tokens for potentially viral tweets

### For Platform Development:
- 30% supporting ongoing development and growth
- Ensures sustainable operation
- Enables continuous improvement and expansion

## Fee Calculation Examples

To illustrate how fees work in practice:

**Example 1: Single Token Performance**
- Daily trading volume for Token A: $100,000
- Total fees generated (0.3%): $300
- Distribution:
    * $MOON stakers share: $60 (20%)
    * Token A stakers share: $120 (40%)
    * Token A creator receives: $30 (10%)
    * Platform receives: $90 (30%)

**Example 2: Platform-Wide Scale**
- Daily trading volume across all tokens: $1,000,000
- Total fees generated (0.3%): $3,000
- Distribution:
    * $MOON stakers share: $600 (20%)
    * All token stakers share: $1,200 (40%, split by token)
    * All creators share: $300 (10%, split by token)
    * Platform receives: $900 (30%)

## Growth-Aligned Incentives

This fee structure creates aligned incentives for ecosystem growth:

1. **$MOON Stakers**: Benefit from overall platform growth and activity
2. **Token Stakers**: Rewarded for supporting specific tokens
3. **Creators**: Motivated to launch tokens with high trading potential
4. **Platform**: Sustainable funding tied directly to usage

Each participant is incentivized to contribute positively to the ecosystem's growth, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of value creation and distribution.
