# How It Works

## The Simple Concept Behind MoonDat.social

MoonDat.social transforms tweet URLs into tradeable tokens through a straightforward process that creates value for all participants.

## Token Creation

Anyone can submit a tweet URL to create a new token with:
- 1 billion total supply
- 85% added to Uniswap liquidity
- 10% reserved for $MOON stakers
- 5% reserved for the tweet author

The person who submits the URL becomes the token creator and earns 10% of all future trading fees.

## Token Distribution

This balanced distribution ensures:
- Immediate tradability through deep liquidity
- Rewards for platform supporters via airdrops
- Value attribution to original content creators
- Incentives aligned across all participants

## Multiple Ways to Earn

The platform creates several revenue streams:

**Creator Rewards:**
- 10% of trading fees for tokens you create
- Lifetime earnings with no expiration

**$MOON Staking:**
- 20% of ALL platform trading fees
- Airdrops from every new token (10:1 ratio)

**Token Staking:**
- 40% of trading fees for specific tokens
- Higher percentage for focused support

## Tweet Author Verification

Authors of tokenized tweets can:
- Verify ownership through Twitter/X
- Claim 5% of token supply (50M tokens)
- Choose which token to verify if multiple exist

Verification often significantly impacts token value.

## Important Mechanics

- Multiple tokens can exist for the same tweet
- Tweet authors can only verify ONE token
- All tokens have 5-day unstaking cooldown periods
- $MOON airdrops have a 5-day claiming window

## The Complete Ecosystem

This creates a self-reinforcing system where:
- Content spotters identify valuable tweets
- Platform supporters receive ongoing rewards
- Tweet authors benefit from verification
- Traders provide liquidity and volume
- All participants share in the value created

MoonDat.social establishes a new paradigm where social content value can be captured, traded, and rewarded in a transparent blockchain ecosystem.
