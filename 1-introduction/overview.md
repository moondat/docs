# Platform Overview

## Bridging Social Media and Blockchain

MoonDat.social connects the world of viral tweets with blockchain technology, allowing anyone to create tokens directly tied to specific tweets. This creates entirely new opportunities for value creation, trading, and community building.

## The Core Concept

At its heart, MoonDat.social enables:
- Token creation based on any tweet URL
- Automatic liquidity on Uniswap (Base chain)
- Verification system for tweet authors
- Rewards for creators, stakers, and verified authors

## Why Tweet Tokens Matter

Tweets drive conversations, move markets, and create cultural momentsâ€”but until now, there was no way to capture this value directly. MoonDat.social changes this by creating a direct connection between impactful social content and tradeable assets.

## Multiple Ways to Participate

The platform supports different participation models:

**For Content Spotters:**
- Create tokens for valuable tweets
- Earn 10% of all trading fees for life

**For Platform Supporters:**

**For Token Believers:**
- Stake specific tokens you value
- Earn 40% of their trading fees

**For Tweet Authors:**
- Verify ownership of your tweets
- Claim 5% of token supply

## The Social Token Opportunity

As social media continues to evolve, the line between social influence and economic value grows increasingly blurred. MoonDat.social creates the infrastructure to make this connection explicit, transparent, and accessible to everyone.
