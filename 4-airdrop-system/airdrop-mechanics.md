# Airdrop Mechanics

## Continuous Value Flow to $MOON Stakers

The MoonDat.social airdrop system creates a unique value distribution mechanism that rewards $MOON stakers with tokens from every new launch.

## The Core Concept

10% of every token's supply (100 million tokens) is reserved for distribution to $MOON stakers through a straightforward claiming mechanism.

## The 10:1 Distribution Ratio

$MOON stakers can claim new tokens at a fixed ratio of **10 $MOON : 1 new token**.

This means:
- Stake 10 $MOON → Claim 1 new token
- Stake 1,000,000 $MOON → Claim 100,000 new tokens
- Stake 10,000,000 $MOON → Claim 1,000,000 new tokens

This fixed ratio ensures proportional distribution based on commitment to the platform.

## Key Benefits

The airdrop system creates several important benefits:

1. **Early Access**: Get tokens before broader market awareness
2. **Zero Additional Cost**: No purchase required beyond staking
3. **Portfolio Diversification**: Exposure to all new tokens
4. **Compounding Potential**: Claimed tokens can be staked or sold to increase $MOON position

## Airdrop Availability

The airdrop allocation works on a first-come basis:
- Total airdrop pool is 100 million tokens per launch
- Claims are fulfilled in order of request
- Popular tokens may see their allocation claimed quickly

## Strategic Airdrop Opportunities

The system creates several strategic possibilities:

1. **Early Claiming**: Be first to claim potentially valuable tokens
2. **Selective Approach**: Choose which tokens to claim based on potential
3. **Portfolio Building**: Create a diverse collection of tweet-based tokens
4. **Stake Scaling**: Increase $MOON stake to access larger airdrop allocations

## Value Projection Examples

To illustrate potential value:

**Conservative Example**:
- 5 new tokens launch weekly
- You stake 5,000,000 $MOON
- Maximum claim: 500,000 tokens from each launch
- If just 1 in 10 tokens reaches $0.0001 value
- Weekly value: 5 × 500,000 × 10% × $0.0001 = $25

**Growth Example**:
- 20 new tokens launch weekly
- You stake 5,000,000 $MOON
- If 20% of tokens reach $0.0005
- Weekly value: 20 × 500,000 × 20% × $0.0005 = $1,000

The airdrop system creates one of the core value propositions for $MOON stakers and forms a central pillar of the MoonDat.social ecosystem.
