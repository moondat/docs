# Distribution Ratio

## The 10:1 Model Explained

MoonDat.social's airdrop system is built on a fixed 10:1 distribution ratio that creates a clear relationship between $MOON staking and token rewards.

## How the Ratio Works

For every new token launched:
- 10% of total supply (100 million tokens) is reserved for airdrops
- $MOON stakers can claim these tokens at a ratio of **10 $MOON : 1 token**
- This means for every 10 $MOON tokens staked, you can claim 1 token from each new launch

## Claim Eligibility Examples

This ratio creates the following claiming relationship:

| $MOON Staked | Maximum Claimable Tokens Per Launch |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| 100,000 | 10,000 |
| 1,000,000 | 100,000 |
| 10,000,000 | 1,000,000 |
| 100,000,000 | 10,000,000 |

## The Strategic Design

The 10:1 ratio was carefully calibrated to achieve several ecosystem objectives:

### Balanced Accessibility
- Accessible to participants of various sizes
- Creates proportional rewards based on commitment
- No disproportionate advantage to any stake size

### Sustainable Distribution
- 100 million token airdrop divided by 10:1 ratio requires 1 billion $MOON staked for full distribution
- Aligns with total $MOON supply for mathematical balance

### Value Alignment
- Rewards proportional to platform commitment
- Encourages meaningful but not excessive $MOON staking
- Creates fair distribution across different stakeholder sizes

## Value Maximization Strategies

The 10:1 ratio creates several strategic considerations:

### Optimal Stake Sizing
Finding the right $MOON stake level based on:
- Expected number of valuable token launches
- Opportunity cost of capital
- Potential value of claimed tokens

### Portfolio Construction
Using the ratio to build a diverse portfolio:
- Broad exposure through claims across many tokens
- Selective claiming for higher-conviction opportunities
- Balanced approach combining both strategies

## Practical Applications

In practice, the 10:1 ratio works as follows:

**Example Scenario**:
- You stake 5,000,000 $MOON tokens
- Maximum claim per token: 500,000 tokens
- With 10 new tokens launching weekly
- Monthly potential: Access to 20 million new tokens
- If just 10% reach modest value, significant portfolio growth

The 10:1 distribution ratio establishes a clear, fair, and mathematically sound foundation for the airdrop system that benefits all ecosystem participants proportionally.
