# Claiming Window

## The 5-Day Opportunity Period

A critical component of the MoonDat.social airdrop system is the 5-day claiming window, which creates a balanced approach to token distribution.

## How the Window Works

When a $MOON staker makes their first claim for a specific token:
1. A 5-day timer begins for that specific token
2. During this period, they can make additional claims up to their maximum eligible amount
3. Claims can be made in any increments and at any time during the window
4. Once the 5-day period expires, they can no longer claim that specific token
5. Each token has its own independent claiming window, starting with first claim

## Balancing Opportunity and Commitment

The 5-day window was designed to balance several ecosystem considerations:

### Evaluation Time
Provides sufficient time to:
- Assess initial token performance
- Research the underlying tweet content
- Monitor trading activity and community interest
- Make informed decisions about claim size

### Commitment Incentives
Creates incentives for:
- Active platform participation
- Regular monitoring of new launches
- Thoughtful claiming strategy
- Ongoing ecosystem engagement

### Fair Distribution
Ensures fair distribution by:
- Preventing unlimited claiming time
- Creating turnover in available airdrop supply
- Allowing more stakers to access popular tokens

## Strategic Window Utilization

The 5-day window enables several strategic approaches:

### Incremental Claiming
- Make a small initial claim to "reserve" your window
- Monitor performance over the first days
- Increase position based on early indicators

### Performance-Based Claiming
- Claim a test position immediately
- Analyze price action, volume, and community interest
- Determine final position size based on performance

### Diversification Strategy
- Make partial claims across multiple tokens
- Allocate remaining claiming capacity based on relative performance
- Prioritize best performers for maximum claims

## Window Limitations

Key constraints of the 5-day window:

1. **Token-Specific**: Each token has its own independent window
2. **Non-Extendable**: The 5-day period cannot be extended
3. **Activation Requirement**: Window only starts after making first claim
4. **Stake Requirement**: Must maintain staked position during claiming period

The 5-day claiming window represents a carefully calibrated mechanism that balances immediate opportunity with thoughtful evaluation, creating the right incentives for active participation while allowing sufficient time for informed decision-making.
