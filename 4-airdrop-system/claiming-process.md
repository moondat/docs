# Claiming Process

## Accessing Your Airdrops

The MoonDat.social airdrop system allows $MOON stakers to claim tokens from new launches through a structured process.

## Claiming Eligibility

To be eligible for airdrops:
- You must have $MOON actively staked (not in unstaking cooldown)
- Your maximum claim is based on your stake (10:1 ratio)
- Tokens must still be available in the airdrop pool

## The Claiming Lifecycle

The claiming process follows a defined lifecycle:

1. **Token Launch**: New token created with 10% allocated to airdrops
2. **Initial Claim**: Make your first claim for any portion of eligible amount
3. **Claim Window Opens**: 5-day period begins for additional claims
4. **Additional Claims**: Claim more tokens within the window (subject to availability)
5. **Window Closes**: Claiming ability ends after 5 days

## First-Come Availability

The airdrop system operates on a first-come basis:
- 100 million tokens available per launch
- No guaranteed allocation - only maximum eligibility
- Popular tokens may see their allocation claimed quickly
- Less popular tokens may have availability throughout the window

## The 5-Day Claim Window

After making your initial claim for a token:
- You have 5 days to make additional claims for that specific token
- Claims can be made in any increments up to your maximum
- After 5 days, you can no longer claim that specific token
- Unclaimed tokens remain available for other stakers

## Strategic Claiming Approaches

Several strategies can optimize your airdrop benefits:

### Selective Claiming
Focus on tokens with higher potential based on the tweet content and author

### Incremental Claiming
Claim partially to test performance before committing to maximum allocation

### Portfolio Diversification
Spread claims across many tokens to build a diverse portfolio

### Volume Focus
Prioritize tokens that show early trading activity and community interest

The airdrop claiming mechanism represents a core value proposition of the MoonDat.social ecosystem, creating ongoing opportunities for $MOON stakers to access new assets.
