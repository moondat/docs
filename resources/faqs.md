# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Platform Questions

### What is MoonDat.social?
MoonDat.social is a platform that allows anyone to create ERC-20 tokens based on tweet URLs. The platform automatically adds liquidity, enables creator rewards, and includes a verification system for tweet authors.

### How is this different from other social tokens?
Most social token platforms focus on creating tokens for entire accounts or communities. MoonDat.social uniquely allows tokenization of individual tweets, creating a more granular and accessible approach to social tokenization.

### What blockchain does MoonDat.social use?
All MoonDat.social tokens are created on Base chain, an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that offers lower fees and faster transactions while maintaining Ethereum security and compatibility.

## Token Creation Questions

### Can I create a token for any tweet?
Yes, you can create a token for any public tweet URL. There are no restrictions on which tweets can be tokenized.

### What happens when I create a token?
When you create a token, our smart contracts generate a new ERC-20 token with 1 billion supply. 85% goes to liquidity on Uniswap, 10% is reserved for $MOON stakers, and 5% is reserved for the tweet author.

### Can multiple tokens be created for the same tweet?
Yes, multiple tokens can be created for the same tweet URL. However, the tweet author can only verify and claim tokens for one of these tokens. This creates an opportunity for creators to compete for the most successful token.

### Do I need permission from the tweet author?
No, you don't need permission to create a token for any tweet. However, the tweet author can verify themselves to claim their 5% allocation on one token of their choosing.

## Verification Questions

### How does tweet author verification work?
Tweet authors can verify ownership through the platform using Twitter OAuth authentication. Once verified, they can claim 5% of the token supply allocated to them for one token associated with their tweet.

### What if I'm a tweet author and someone tokenized my tweet?
If someone has created a token based on your tweet, you can visit MoonDat.social and verify your ownership to claim your 5% token allocation. If multiple tokens exist for your tweet, you can choose which one to verify.

## Staking Questions

### What's the difference between staking $MOON and staking tokens?
$MOON staking earns you 20% of all trading fees across the platform plus airdrops from new tokens. Individual token staking earns you 40% of the trading fees specifically for that token.

### How is the 10:1 airdrop ratio calculated?
For every 10 $MOON tokens you stake, you can claim 1 token from any new launch. For example, if you stake 5 million $MOON, you can claim up to 500,000 tokens from each new launch.

### What is the unstaking cooldown period?
Both $MOON and individual token staking have a 5-day cooldown period for unstaking. During this time, you won't earn any rewards, and you can't claim airdrops.

## Trading Questions

### Where can I trade these tokens?
All tokens can be traded on Uniswap (Base chain). They appear like any other ERC-20 token and can be traded using standard Uniswap interfaces.

### How is the initial token price determined?
The initial price is determined by the ratio of ETH to tokens in the Uniswap liquidity pool. With 85% of token supply added to liquidity, there's typically sufficient depth for immediate trading.

### What trading fees are charged?
The standard Uniswap fee of 0.3% applies to all trades. This fee is then distributed according to our fee structure: 20% to $MOON stakers, 40% to token stakers, 10% to creators, and 30% to the platform.

## Economic Questions

### How do creators earn revenue?
Token creators earn 10% of all trading fees generated by the tokens they create, forever. This creates a potential passive income stream from successful token launches.

### How valuable can these tokens become?
Token value is determined by market forces of supply and demand. Tokens representing viral or historically significant tweets could potentially become quite valuable if there's sufficient interest and trading volume.

### Is this sustainable long-term?
The model is designed for sustainability through the fee structure. As long as tokens continue to trade, the fee distribution system ensures all participants receive proportional rewards, creating aligned incentives for long-term growth.
